# Rulebook eval review: v6 (AI + embedding RAG rules)

Written 2026-10-21 21:34:56. Read the reasons and check whether the AI made up a rule that is not in the rulebook.

## Wrong cards (4)

### Wrong N5 (run 1, confusing)

- Card: "Deal 4 damage and heal 6."
- AI output: reject=true, effects=[], cost=0
- Final answer: reject, cost <null>
- Expected: [STRIKE 4 enemy NONE; MEND 6 self NONE] OR [MEND 6 self NONE; STRIKE 4 enemy NONE] cost 10
- Reason given: The card combines damage and healing into two separate actions, but there is no single keyword that can do this without either dealing self-damage (RECKLESS) or combining it into a life-steal (SIPHON) with matching values.

### Wrong N5 (run 2, confusing)

- Card: "Deal 4 damage and heal 6."
- AI output: reject=true, effects=[], cost=0
- Final answer: reject, cost <null>
- Expected: [STRIKE 4 enemy NONE; MEND 6 self NONE] OR [MEND 6 self NONE; STRIKE 4 enemy NONE] cost 10
- Reason given: The card has two separate actions (deal damage and heal) but no single keyword covers both without conditions or scaling like SIPHON. Siphon deals damage and heals by the same amount, but here the values are different (4 damage and 6 healing).

### Wrong N6 (run 2, confusing)

- Card: "Deal 6 damage. Repeat it."
- AI output: reject=false, effects=[STRIKE 6 enemy NONE; ECHO null none NONE], cost=8
- Final answer: [STRIKE 6 enemy NONE; ECHO null none NONE], cost 8
- Expected: [STRIKE 6 enemy NONE; ECHO null none NONE] OR [STRIKE 6 enemy NONE; STRIKE 6 enemy NONE] cost 12
- Reason given: The card can be implemented using STRIKE and ECHO effects.

### Wrong N5 (run 3, confusing)

- Card: "Deal 4 damage and heal 6."
- AI output: reject=true, effects=[], cost=0
- Final answer: reject, cost <null>
- Expected: [STRIKE 4 enemy NONE; MEND 6 self NONE] OR [MEND 6 self NONE; STRIKE 4 enemy NONE] cost 10
- Reason given: The card has two separate actions (deal damage and heal) but only one effect can be applied per keyword. SIPHON combines damage and healing into one action, but the numbers requested (4 damage, 6 heal) do not match.
